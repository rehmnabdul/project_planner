# Plex Project Planner Constitution

## Core Principles

### Code Quality Standards
All code must follow .NET coding conventions with static analysis tools (Roslyn analyzers, StyleCop) configured and enforced. Code must be clean, maintainable, and follow SOLID principles. Complex methods should be refactored, and proper documentation (XML comments) must be maintained.

### Testing Standards Compliance
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory with comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. A minimum of 85% code coverage is required with critical paths having 95%+ coverage. Tests must be fast, deterministic, and independent.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Implementation
The system must be architected following Domain-Driven Design principles with clear separation of concerns using bounded contexts, domain models, aggregates, and repositories. Domain logic must be isolated from infrastructure concerns.

### User Experience Consistency
All UI elements must follow a consistent design system using Blazor components that provide uniform look, feel, and behavior. Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) must be met, and responsive design principles applied.

### Performance Requirements
Applications must respond to user interactions within 200ms for common operations, with page load times under 3 seconds. Memory usage must be optimized, and the system should support at least 1000 concurrent users.

## Technology Stack Requirements

This application must be built using ASP.NET 9.0 as the web framework, .NET Aspire for cloud-ready application composition and observability, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for architectural organization, and Blazor for the user interface. The primary language is C#, with Entity Framework Core for data access, and either PostgreSQL or SQL Server for persistence.

## Development Workflow

All development follows a feature branching model with mandatory code reviews for all pull requests. Automated CI/CD pipelines must pass before merging. The team follows semantic versioning practices and holds regular retrospectives to improve development processes. Development tasks must be organized following user stories and acceptance criteria.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and guides all architectural decisions. Amendments require team consensus and documented approval. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Any complexity introduced must be justified against these established standards.
