# Research: ClickUp Clone Application

## Decision: Technology Stack Selection

### Rationale:
The technology stack was specified as .NET 9.0, Aspire, DDD, Blazor, and MSSQL. This stack was chosen to align with the constitutional principles and provide a modern, maintainable, scalable architecture for the project management application.

## Decision: Domain-Driven Design Architecture

### Rationale:
Following the constitutional requirement for DDD implementation, the architecture will be organized around business domains with clear separation of concerns using bounded contexts, domain models, aggregates, and repositories. Domain logic will be isolated from infrastructure concerns.

### Bounded Contexts Identified:
1. **Project Context** - Managing projects and associated settings
2. **Task Context** - Handling task creation, assignment, and tracking
3. **Collaboration Context** - Managing comments, mentions, and notifications
4. **User Context** - Handling authentication, authorization, and user profiles

## Decision: Data Persistence Strategy

### Rationale:
Microsoft SQL Server was chosen as the primary database because:
- It integrates well with the .NET ecosystem
- Provides strong transactional guarantees needed for project management data
- Supports complex queries needed for dashboard and reporting features
- Offers good performance characteristics for the expected concurrent user load
- Provides robust security features

Entity Framework Core will be used as the ORM with appropriate patterns that support DDD principles, such as Repository pattern and Specification pattern.

## Decision: Blazor UI Framework

### Rationale:
Blazor was chosen as the UI framework to align with the constitutional requirement and for the following benefits:
- Leverages C# skills across frontend and backend
- Provides rich, interactive UI capabilities
- Enables server-side rendering with Blazor Server or WebAssembly capabilities with Blazor Wasm
- Good integration with .NET ecosystem and authentication patterns
- Supports responsive design and accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Enables component-based architecture that aligns with DDD principles

## Decision: Performance Optimization Approach

### Rationale:
To meet the constitutional performance requirements (<200ms response time, <3s page load) and support up to 500 concurrent users:
- Implement caching strategies using built-in .NET caching mechanisms
- Use async/await patterns throughout the application
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use SignalR for real-time collaboration features

## Decision: Testing Strategy

### Rationale:
To meet the constitutional requirement of TDD approach with 85%+ test coverage:
- Unit tests for domain entities and business logic using xUnit
- Integration tests for data access and API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user journeys using Playwright or similar
- Mocking frameworks to isolate units of code
- Test coverage tools to maintain minimum 85% coverage, 95%+ for critical paths

## Decision: .NET Aspire for Deployment

### Rationale:
.NET Aspire was chosen for deployment to align with constitutional requirements:
- Provides cloud-ready application composition
- Built-in observability and health checks
- Simplified containerization and orchestration
- Integration with Azure and other cloud providers if needed
- Simplified local development environment setup

## Decision: Authentication and Authorization

### Rationale:
For user authentication via email/password with support for up to 500 concurrent users:
- Implement ASP.NET Core Identity for user management
- Use JWT tokens or traditional session-based authentication
- Role-based and claim-based authorization for feature access
- Secure password storage with appropriate hashing
- Account lockout and security measures to prevent attacks

## Decision: File Attachment Management

### Rationale:
To support file attachments and document management as per functional requirements:
- Implement secure file upload functionality
- Store files in a structured way with appropriate metadata
- Implement appropriate security measures (file type validation, virus scanning)
- Consider cloud storage options for scalability if needed
- Provide file versioning and access control

## Decision: Real-time Collaboration Features

### Rationale:
To implement the real-time collaboration features (comments, mentions, notifications):
- Use SignalR for real-time communication
- Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Design appropriate message formats for different notification types
- Handle connection failures gracefully
- Implement proper security and authorization for real-time features

## Decision: Search and Filtering Implementation

### Rationale:
To meet the requirement for fast search across potentially 10,000+ tasks:
- Implement efficient database indexing strategies
- Consider full-text search capabilities in MSSQL
- Implement pagination and filtering at the database level
- Use caching for frequently accessed search results
- Consider search result ranking based on relevance
