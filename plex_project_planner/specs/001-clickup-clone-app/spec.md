# Feature Specification: ClickUp Clone Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-clickup-clone-app`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can be use as task manager, project manager or project planner. I use ClickUp for my project management. So i want to create a custom ClickUp app clone that will provide all the click up functionality as free for me locally. It should give me all the features ClickUp provide and I can use all the features."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Manage Projects (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create, organize, and manage projects in a centralized workspace so that I can keep track of different initiatives and their progress.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational feature that enables all other functionality. Without the ability to create and manage projects, the rest of the application is meaningless.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a project workspace and organizing tasks within it, delivering the core value of project management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged into the application, **When** I create a new project workspace, **Then** the project appears in my project list with its own task management area
2. **Given** I have an existing project, **When** I add project details and settings, **Then** those details are saved and displayed consistently across the application

### User Story 2 - Task Management and Tracking (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create, assign, and track tasks within projects so that I can manage my work effectively and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

**Why this priority**: Tasks are the core building blocks of any project management system. This functionality directly addresses the primary need to track work items.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating tasks, assigning them, updating their status, and tracking their progress, delivering the core task management value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a project workspace, **When** I create a new task, **Then** the task appears in the appropriate list with all entered details preserved
2. **Given** I have tasks in various statuses, **When** I update a task's status or assign it to someone, **Then** those changes are reflected immediately across the application

---

### User Story 3 - Team Collaboration and Communication (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to collaborate with team members on tasks and projects through comments and mentions so that we can work together effectively and stay aligned.

**Why this priority**: While individual task management is essential, the ability to collaborate is what makes project management tools valuable for teams and distinguishes them from simple to-do lists.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating comments and mentions on tasks, delivering the collaboration value without requiring all other features to be complete.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am working on a shared project, **When** I add a comment to a task, **Then** team members can see my comment and respond appropriately
2. **Given** I need team member attention, **When** I mention them in a comment, **Then** they receive a notification about the mention

---

### User Story 4 - Dashboard and Reporting (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to view project progress, task status, and productivity metrics through dashboards so that I can make informed decisions about my projects.

**Why this priority**: While project and task creation is critical, the ability to visualize progress and report on work is important for decision-making and project success.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing dashboards with existing project data, delivering the value of progress visibility without requiring all other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have ongoing projects and tasks, **When** I navigate to the dashboard, **Then** I see current project status and task completion metrics
2. **Given** I want to review work over time, **When** I access reporting features, **Then** I can see productivity metrics and project timelines

---

### User Story 5 - Custom Workflows and Statuses (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to customize workflows and task statuses to match my team's working methods so that the system adapts to my processes rather than forcing me to change.

**Why this priority**: This is an advanced feature that enhances the value of the basic functionality but isn't necessary for core use cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating custom workflows and applying them to tasks, delivering the value of process customization without requiring all other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a project with specific workflow needs, **When** I create custom task statuses, **Then** I can apply these statuses to tasks within the project
2. **Given** I have established custom workflows, **When** tasks move through different stages, **Then** the system accurately reflects the custom process

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple users edit the same task simultaneously?
- How does the system handle network interruptions during critical updates?
- What happens when the local application storage limit is reached?
- How does the system handle importing large numbers of tasks from external sources?
