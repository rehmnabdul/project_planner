# Implementation Plan: ClickUp Clone Application

**Branch**: `001-clickup-clone-app` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: [link](/specs/001-clickup-clone-app/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-clickup-clone-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a ClickUp clone application using .NET 9.0 with DDD architecture, Aspire for deployment, and Blazor UI. The system will support project management, task tracking, team collaboration, dashboards, and customizable workflows. Based on the feature specification and constitutional requirements for code quality, testing standards, DDD, UX consistency, and performance.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# .NET 9.0  
**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core, .NET Aspire, Entity Framework Core, Blazor, Microsoft SQL Server  
**Storage**: Microsoft SQL Server  
**Testing**: xUnit with minimum 85% coverage  
**Target Platform**: Web application (cross-platform)  
**Project Type**: Web application with Blazor UI (DDD architecture)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms response time for common operations, <3s page load time  
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance, support up to 500 concurrent users  
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user project planning application with domain-driven design

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Pre-Design Compliance Check
- Code Quality Standards: Static analysis tools (Roslyn/StyleCop) configured and enforced
- Testing Standards: TDD approach with 85%+ test coverage requirement (95%+ for critical paths)
- DDD Implementation: Architecture follows Domain-Driven Design with bounded contexts
- User Experience: Blazor UI components follow consistent design system, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Performance Requirements: Response times <200ms, page loads <3s, supports 500+ concurrent users
- Technology Stack: Built with ASP.NET 9.0, .NET Aspire, DDD, and Blazor as required

### Post-Design Compliance Check
- ✅ DDD Architecture implemented with clear bounded contexts (Project, Task, Collaboration, User contexts)
- ✅ Technology stack aligned with constitutional requirements (.NET 9.0, Aspire, Blazor, EF Core)
- ✅ Performance targets incorporated in design (caching, async patterns, DB optimization)
- ✅ Testing strategy includes unit, integration, and E2E tests to meet coverage requirements
- ✅ Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA) considered in UI component design
- ✅ Data persistence strategy using SQL Server meets constitutional requirements

**Structure Decision**: DDD architecture with .NET Aspire app host for cloud-ready deployment. Core contains domain entities and business logic, Application handles use cases, Infrastructure manages data access and external services, and Web handles presentation layer including Blazor components.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| DDD Architecture | Required by constitutional principle for this project type | Simpler layered architecture would not meet constitutional DDD requirement |
| .NET Aspire | Required by constitutional principle for cloud-ready deployment | Traditional deployment approach would not meet constitutional requirement |
